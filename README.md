# My-First-Website
The first website I am building for myself. I recently started learning to code throuhg OpenClassrooms.com and want to build a basic website for posting my thoughts and ideas. 
The title of the website should be something like "The Doctor who Codes" perhaps 
I commit to work on it as a side project, InshaÂ´Allah
